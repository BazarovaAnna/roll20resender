### How to use
1. `npm install` - to install deps
2. `node server.js` - to run a server that will handle rolls.
You`ll need a Pixels app that will send requests from dice (I just send it to local network ip address - e.g. http://192.168.x.x/roll)
4. Install extension (roll20-chat-injector) to browser
5. Enable it and run roll20 game
6. Open chat, roll the die and see it pasting messages
